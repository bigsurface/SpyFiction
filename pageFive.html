        <span style="background-color: black">The Man Who Died

I returned from</span> the City <span style="background-color: black">about three o'clock on that May afternoon pretty well disgusted with life. I had been three months in</span> the Old Country <span style="background-color: black">, and was fed up with it. If any one had told me a year ago that I would have been feeling like that I should have laughed at him; but there was the fact. The weather made me liverish, the talk of the ordinary Englishman made me sick, I couldn't get enough exercise, and the amusements of</span> London <span style="background-color: black">seemed as </span> flat <span style="background-color: black">as soda-water that has been standing in the sun. *'Richard Hannay,' I kept telling myself, 'you have got into the wrong</span> ditch, <span style="background-color: black">my friend, and you had better climb out.'

It made me bite my lips to think of the plans I had been</span> building <span style="background-color: black">up those last years in</span> Bulawayo. <span style="background-color: black">I had got my pile - not one of the big ones, but good enough for me; and I had figured out all kinds of ways of enjoying myself. My father had brought me out from</span> Scotland <span style="background-color: black">at the age of six, and I had never been home since; so</span> England <span style="background-color: black">was a sort of Arabian Nights to me, and I counted on stopping there for the rest of my days.

But from the first I was disappointed with it. In about a week I was tired of seeing sights, and in less than a month I had had enough of</span> restaurants and theatres <span style="background-color: black">and race-meetings. I had no real pal to go about with, which probably explains things. Plenty of people invited me to their</span> houses, <span style="background-color: black"> but they didn't seem much interested in me. They would fling me a question or two about</span> South Africa, <span style="background-color: black"> and then get on to their own affairs. A lot of Imperialist ladies asked me to tea to meet schoolmasters from</span> New Zealand <span style="background-color: black">and editors from</span> Vancouver, <span style="background-color: black">and that was the dismalest business of all. Here was I, thirty-seven years old, sound in wind and limb, with enough money to have a good time, yawning my head off all day. I had just about settled to clear out and get back to</span> the veld, <span style="background-color: black">for I was the best bored man in the</span> United Kingdom. <span style="background-color: black">

That afternoon I had ben worrying my brokers about investments to give my mind something to work on, and on my way home I turned into my club - rather</span> a pot-house, <span style="background-color: black">which took in Colonial members. I had a long drink, and read the evening papers. They were full of the row in</span> the Near East, <span style="background-color: black">and there was an article about Karolides, the Greek Premier. I rather fancied the chap. From all accounts he seemed the one big man in the show; and he played a straight game too, which was more than could be said for most of them. I gathered that they hated him pretty blackly in</span> Berlin and Vienna, <span style="background-color: black">but that we were going to stick by him, and one paper said that he was the only barrier between</span> Europe <span style="background-color: black">and Armagedon. I remember wondering if I could get a job in those parts. It struck me that</span> Albania <span style="background-color: black">was the sort of</span> place <span style="background-color: black">that might keep a man from yawning.

About six o'clock I went home, dressed, dined at</span> Portland Place. <span style="background-color: black">The crowd surged past me on</span> the pavements, <span style="background-color: black">busy and chattering, and I envied the people for having something to do. These shop-girls and clerks and dandies and policemen had some interest in life that kept them going. I gave half-a-crown to a beggar because I saw him yawn; he was a fellow-sufferer. At</span> Oxford Circus <span style="background-color: black">I looked up into the spring sky and I made a vow. I would give the</span> Old Country <span style="background-color: black">another day to fit me into something; if nothing happened, I would take the next boat for</span> the Cape. <span style="background-color: black">

My</span> flat <span style="background-color: black">was the</span> first floor <span style="background-color: black">in a</span> new block <span style="background-color: black">behind</span> Langham Place. <span style="background-color: black">There was a common</span> staircase, <span style="background-color: black">with a porter and a liftman at the entrance, but there was no restaurant or anything of that sort, and each flat was quite shut off from the others. I hate servants on the</span> premises, <span style="background-color: black">so I had a fellow to look after me who came in by the day. He arrived before eight o'clock every morning and used to depart at seven, for I never dined at home.

I was just fitting my key into</span> the door <span style="background-color: black">when I noticed a man at my elbow. I had not seen him approach, and the sudden appearance made me start. He was a slim man, with a short brown beard and small, gimlety blue eyes. I recognized him as the occupant of a flat on the</span> top floor, <span style="background-color: black">with whom I had passed the time of day on</span> the stairs. <span style="background-color: black">

'Can I speak to you?' he said. 'May I come in for a minute?' He was steadying his voice with an effort, and his hand was pawing my arm.

I got my door open and motioned him in. No sooner was he over</span> the threshold <span style="background-color: black">than he made a dash for my back</span>-room, <span style="background-color: black">where I used to smoke and write my letters. Then he bolted back.

'Is the door locked?' he asked feverishly, and he fastened the chain with his own hand.

'I'm very sorry,' he said humbly. 'It's a mighty liberty, but you looked the kind of man who would understand. I've had you in my mind all this week when things got troublesome. Say, will you do me a good turn?'

'I'll listen to you,' I said. 'That's all I'll promise.' I was getting worried by the antics of this nervous little chap.

There was a tray of drinks on a table beside him, from which he filled himself a stiff whisky-and-soda. He drank it off in three gulps, and cracked the glass as he set it down.

'Pardon,' he said, 'I'm a bit rattled tonight. You see, I happen at this moment to be dead.'

I sat down in an arm-chair and lit my pipe.

'What does it feel like?' I asked. I was pretty certain that I had to deal with a madman.

A smile flickered over his drawn face. 'I'm not mad - yet. Say, sir, I've been watching you, and I reckon you're a cool customer. I reckon, too, you're an honest man, and not afraid of playing a bold hand. I'm going to confide in you. I need help worse than any man ever needed it, and I want to know if I can count you in.'

'Get on with your yarn,' I said, 'and I'll tell you.'

He seemed to brace himself for a great effort, and then started on the queerest rigmarole. I didn't get hold of it at first, and I had to stop and ask him questions. But here is the gist of it:

He was an American, from</span> Kentucky, <span style="background-color: black">and after</span> college, <span style="background-color: black">being pretty well off, he had started out to see</span> the world. <span style="background-color: black">He wrote a bit, and acted as war correspondent for a</span> Chicago <span style="background-color: black">paper, and spent a year or two in</span> south-eastern Europe. <span style="background-color: black">I gathered that he was a fine linguist, and had got to know pretty well the society in those parts. He spoke familiarly of many names that I remembered to have seen in the newspapers.

He had played about with politics, he told me, at first for the interest of them, and then because he couldn't help himself. I read him as a sharp, restless fellow, who always wanted to get down to the roots of things. He got a little further down than he wanted.

I am giving you what he told me as well as I could make it out. Away behind all the Governments and the armies there was a big</span> subterranean <span style="background-color: black">movement going on, engineered by very dangerous people. He had come on it by accident; it fascinated him; he went further, and then he got caught. I gathered that most of the people in it were the sort of educated anarchists that make revolutions, but that beside them there were financiers who were playing for money. A clever man can make big profits on a falling market, and it suited the book of both classes to set </span> Europe <span style="background-color: black">by the ears.

He told me some queer things that explained a lot that had puzzled me - things that happened in the Balkan War, how one state suddenly came out on top, why alliances were made and broken, why certain men disappeared, and where the sinews of war came from. The aim of the whole conspiracy was to get</span> Russia and Germany <span style="background-color: black">at loggerheads.

When I asked why, he said that the anarchist lot thought it would give them their chance. Everything would be in the meltingpot, and they looked to see</span> a new world <span style="background-color: black">emerge. The capitalists would rake in the shekels, and make fortunes by buying up wreckage. Capital, he said, had no conscience and no fatherland. Besides, the Jew was behind it, and the Jew hated</span> Russia <span style="background-color: black">worse than hell.

'Do you wonder?' he cried. 'For three hundred years they have been persecuted, and this is the return match for the pogroms. The Jew is everywhere, but you have to go far down</span> the backstairs <span style="background-color: black">to find him. Take any big Teutonic business concern. If you have dealings with it the first man you meet is Prince von und zu Something, an elegant young man who talks Eton-and-Harrow English. But he cuts no ice. If your business is big, you get behind him and find a prognathous Westphalian with a retreating brow and the manners of a hog. He is the German business man that gives your English papers the shakes. But if you're on the biggest kind of job and are bound to get to the real boss, ten to one you are brought up against a little white-faced Jew in a bath-chair with an eye like a rattlesnake. Yes, sir, he is the man who is ruling the world just now, and he has his knife in the Empire of the Tzar, because his aunt was outraged and his father flogged in some one-horse location on</span> the Volga <span style="background-color: black">.'
