        The Man <span style="background-color: black">Who</span> Died <span style="background-color: black">

I returned from the City about three o'clock on that May afternoon pretty well</span> disgusted with life. <span style="background-color: black">I had been three months in the Old Country, and was</span> fed <span style="background-color: black">up with it. If</span> any one <span style="background-color: black">had told me a year ago that I would have been</span> feeling <span style="background-color: black">like that I should have laughed at him; but there was the fact. The weather made me liverish, the talk of the</span> ordinary <span style="background-color: black">Englishman </span> made <span style="background-color: black">me</span> sick, <span style="background-color: black">I couldn't get</span> enough exercise, <span style="background-color: black">and the</span> amusements <span style="background-color: black">of London seemed as flat as soda-water that has been</span> standing <span style="background-color: black">in the sun. 'Richard Hannay,' I kept telling myself, 'you have got into the wrong ditch, my</span> friend, <span style="background-color: black">and you had better climb out.'

It made me</span> bite <span style="background-color: black">my</span> lips <span style="background-color: black">to think of the plans I had been building up those last years in Bulawayo. I had got my pile - not one of the big ones, but</span> good enough <span style="background-color: black">for me; and I had figured out</span> all kinds of ways <span style="background-color: black">of enjoying myself. My</span> father <span style="background-color: black">had brought me out from Scotland at the</span> age <span style="background-color: black">of six, and I had never been</span> home <span style="background-color: black">since; so England was a sort of Arabian Nights to me, and I counted on stopping there for the rest of my days.

But from the first I was</span> disappointed <span style="background-color: black">with it. In about a week I was</span> tired <span style="background-color: black">of</span> seeing <span style="background-color: black">sights, and in less than a month I had had enough of restaurants and theatres and</span> race<span style="background-color: black">-</span>meetings<span style="background-color: black">. I had</span> no real pal <span style="background-color: black">to go about with, which probably explains things. Plenty of</span> people <span style="background-color: black">invited me to their houses, but they didn't seem much interested in me. They would</span> fling <span style="background-color: black">me a</span> question <span style="background-color: black">or two about South Africa, and then get on to their own</span> affairs. <span style="background-color: black">A lot of</span> Imperialist <span style="background-color: black">ladies asked me to tea to meet</span> schoolmasters <span style="background-color: black">from New Zealand and</span> editors <span style="background-color: black">from Vancouver, and that was the</span> dismalest business <span style="background-color: black"> of all. Here was I, thirty-seven years old, sound in</span> wind and limb, <span style="background-color: black">with enough</span> money <span style="background-color: black"> to have a good time, yawning my</span> head off <span style="background-color: black">all day. I had just about settled to</span> clear out <span style="background-color: black">and get back to the veld, for I was the best</span> bored <span style="background-color: black">man in the United Kingdom.

That afternoon I had been worrying my</span> brokers <span style="background-color: black">about</span> investments <span style="background-color: black">to give my</span> mind <span style="background-color: black">something to</span> work <span style="background-color: black">on, and on my way</span> home <span style="background-color: black">I turned into my</span> club <span style="background-color: black">- rather a pot-house, which took in Colonial</span> members. <span style="background-color: black">I had a long drink, and read the evening papers. They were full of the row in the Near East, and there was an article about Karolides, the Greek Premier. I rather fancied the chap. From all accounts he seemed the one big man in</span> the show; <span style="background-color: black">and he played a straight</span> game <span style="background-color: black">too, which was more than could be said for most of them. I gathered that they</span> hated <span style="background-color: black">him</span> pretty <span style="background-color: black">blackly in Berlin and Vienna, but that we were going to stick by him, and one paper said that he was the only barrier between Europe and Armagedon. I</span> remember wondering <span style="background-color: black">if I could get a job in those parts. It</span> struck <span style="background-color: black">me that Albania was the sort of place that might keep a man from yawning.

About six o'clock I went home, dressed, dined at Portland Place.</span> The crowd <span style="background-color: black">surged past me on the pavements, busy and chattering, and I envied</span> the people <span style="background-color: black"> for having something to do. These</span> shop-girls <span style="background-color: black">and</span> clerks <span style="background-color: black">and</span> dandies <span style="background-color: black">and</span> police<span style="background-color: black">men had some interest in</span> life <span style="background-color: black">that kept them going. I gave half-a-crown to</span> a beggar because <span style="background-color: black">I saw him yawn; he was a</span> fellow-sufferer. <span style="background-color: black">At Oxford Circus I looked up into the spring sky and I made a</span> vow. <span style="background-color: black">I would give the Old Country another day to</span> fit <span style="background-color: black">me into something; if nothing happened, I would take the next boat for the Cape.

My flat was the first floor in a new block</span> behind <span style="background-color: black">Langham Place. There was a</span> common <span style="background-color: black">staircase, with a</span> porter <span style="background-color: black">and</span> a liftman <span style="background-color: black">at the entrance, but there was no restaurant or anything of that sort, and each flat was quite shut off from the others. I</span> hate servants <span style="background-color: black">on the premises, so I had a</span> fellow <span style="background-color: black">to look after me who came in by the day. He arrived before eight o'clock every morning and used to depart at seven, for I never dined at home.

I was just fitting my key into the door when I</span> noticed <span style="background-color: black">a man at my elbow. I had not seen him</span> approach, <span style="background-color: black">and the</span> sudden appearance <span style="background-color: black">made me start. He was a</span> slim <span style="background-color: black">man, with a</span> short <span style="background-color: black">brown beard and</span> small, <span style="background-color: black">gimlety blue</span> eyes. <span style="background-color: black">I</span> recognized <span style="background-color: black">him as the occupant of a flat on the top floor, with whom I had</span> passed the time <span style="background-color: black">of day on the stairs.

'Can I speak to you?' he said. 'May I come in for a</span> minute? <span style="background-color: black">' He was steadying his voice with</span> an effort, <span style="background-color: black">and his</span> hand <span style="background-color: black">was</span> paw<span style="background-color: black"></span>ing my</span> arm.<span style="background-color: black">

I got my door</span>open<span style="background-color: black">and</span> motion<span style="background-color: black">ed him in. No sooner was he over the threshold than he made a</span> dash <span style="background-color: black">for my</span>back-<span style="background-color: black">room, where I</span> used to smoke <span style="background-color: black">and</span> write <span style="background-color: black">my</span> letters. <span style="background-color: black">Then he</span> bolted back. <span style="background-color: black">

'Is the door locked?' he asked</span> fever<span style="background-color: black">ishly, and he fastened the chain with his own</span> hand. <span style="background-color: black">

'I'm very sorry,' he said humbly. 'It's a mighty</span> liberty, <span style="background-color: black">but you looked the kind of man who would</span> understand. <span style="background-color: black">I've had you in my</span> mind <span style="background-color: black">all this week when things got</span> troublesome. <span style="background-color: black">Say, will you do me a good turn?'

'I'll listen to you,' I said. 'That's all I'll</span> promise. <span style="background-color: black">' I was getting</span> worried <span style="background-color: black">by the</span> antics <span style="background-color: black">of this</span> nervous <span style="background-color: black">little chap.

There was a tray of drinks on a table beside him, from which he filled himself a</span> stiff <span style="background-color: black">whisky-and-soda. He drank it off in three</span> gulps, <span style="background-color: black">and cracked the glass as he set it down.

'Pardon,' he said, 'I'm a bit rattled tonight. You see, I happen at this moment to be</span> dead.' <span style="background-color: black">

I sat down in an</span> arm- <span style="background-color: black">chair and lit my pipe.

'What does it</span> feel <span style="background-color: black">like?' I asked. I was pretty certain that I had to</span> deal <span style="background-color: black">with a madman.

A smile flickered over his drawn face. 'I'm not mad - yet. Say, sir, I've been watching you, and I reckon you're a cool customer. I reckon, too, you're an honest man, and not afraid of playing a bold hand. I'm going to confide in you. I need help worse than any man ever needed it, and I want to know if I can count you in.'

'Get on with your yarn,' I said, 'and I'll tell you.'

He seemed to</span> brace him <span style="background-color: black">self for a great effort, and then started on the queerest rigmarole. I didn't </span> get hold <span style="background-color: black">of it at first, and I had to stop and </span> ask <span style="background-color: black">him </span> questions. <span style="background-color: black"> But here is the gist of it:

He was an American, from Kentucky, and after </span> college, <span style="background-color: black">being pretty well off, he had started out to see the world. He wrote a bit, and </span> acted <span style="background-color: black">as war correspondent for a Chicago paper, and spent a year or two in south-eastern Europe. I gathered that he was a fine linguist, and had got to know pretty well the </span> society <span style="background-color: black">in those parts. He spoke </span> familiar <span style="background-color: black">ly of many names that I remembered to have seen in the newspapers.

He had played about with </span> politics, <span style="background-color: black">he told me, at first for the </span> interest <span style="background-color: black">of them, and then because he couldn't help himself. I read him as a sharp, restless fellow, who always wanted to get down to the roots of things. He got a little further down than he wanted.

I am giving you what he told me as well as I could make it out. Away behind all the </span> Governments <span style="background-color: black"> and the </span> armies <span style="background-color: black">there was a big subterranean movement going on, engineered by very dangerous people. He had come on it by accident; it </span> fascinated <span style="background-color: black">him; he went further, and then he got </span> caught. <span style="background-color: black">I gathered that most of the </span> people <span style="background-color: black"> in it were the sort of </span> educated <span style="background-color: black">anarchists that make revolutions, but that beside them there were </span> financiers <span style="background-color: black"> who were playing for money. A clever man can make big profits on a falling </span> market, <span style="background-color: black">and it suited the book of both </span> classes <span style="background-color: black">to set Europe by the ears.

He told me some queer things that explained a lot that had puzzled me - things that happened in the Balkan War, how one state suddenly came out on top, why </span> alliances <span style="background-color: black">were made and broken, why certain men disappeared, and where the </span> sinews <span style="background-color: black">of war came from. The aim of the whole conspiracy was to get Russia and Germany at logger</span>heads.<span style="background-color: black">

When I asked why, he said that the anarchist lot thought it would give them their chance. Everything would be in the </span> meltingpot, <span style="background-color: black">and they </span> looked <span style="background-color: black">to see a new world emerge. The </span> capitalists <span style="background-color: black">would rake in the shekels, and make </span> fortunes <span style="background-color: black">by buying up wreckage. Capital, he said, had no </span> conscience <span style="background-color: black">and no </span>father<span style="background-color: black">land. Besides, the Jew was behind it, and the Jew hated Russia worse than hell.

'Do you </span> wonder?<span style="background-color: black">' he cried. 'For three hundred years they have been </span> persecuted, <span style="background-color: black">and this is the return </span>match<span style="background-color: black">for the pogroms. The Jew is everywhere, but you have to go far down the backstairs to find him. Take any big Teutonic </span> business <span style="background-color: black">concern. If you have </span> dealings <span style="background-color: black">with it the first man you meet is Prince von und zu Something, an elegant young man who talks Eton-and-Harrow English. But he cuts no ice. If your </span> business <span style="background-color: black">is big, you get behind him and find a prognathous Westphalian with a retreating brow and the </span> manners <span style="background-color: black">of a hog. He is the German </span>business <span style="background-color: black">man that gives your English papers the </span>shakes. <span style="background-color: black">But if you're on the biggest kind of job and are bound to get to the </span> real <span style="background-color: black">boss, ten to one you are brought up against a little white-</span>face<span style="background-color: black">d Jew in a bath-chair with an </span>eye <span style="background-color: black">like a rattlesnake. Yes, sir, he is the man who is ruling the world just now, and he has his knife in the Empire of the Tzar, because his aunt was outraged and his father flogged in some one-horse location on the Volga.'
